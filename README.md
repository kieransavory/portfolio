New portfolio 

Althought interesting, my previous portfolio proved to be a difficult user interface to interact with. I believe that this could impact user retention 
negatively. Therefore, I have decided to build a new portfolio that is easier to use, incorporates simplistic animations and is both performant and 
engaging.
